# Azure-ADF-Pipeline-Sush

### Project Description 
This project involves creating an end-to-end batch processing pipeline using Azure Data 
Factory (ADF). I will simulate raw data storage in Azure Blob Storage, design a pipeline in 
ADF for data movement and transformation, and load the processed data into Azure SQL 
Database or Azure Synapse Analytics for further analysis.
